# Our Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a digital archive considering the juxtaposed elements related to the distribution and production of queer zines, emphasizing productions from the Global South and Latin America. On the one hand, we believe that it is critical to visibilize zines from the Global South because such productions encompass marginalized experiences from colonized and Indigenous groups that are often overlooked in major archives. On the other hand, we defend that building bridges with the insurgent zine production from the Global North can serve as an exercise of solidarity and allyship, establishing a shared commitment of challenging imperialism, cis, and heteronormativity. We argue that such an effort becomes a critical intervention on how the archive can serve as a tool to erase the memory and history of marginalized communities within marginalized communities. Although other projects have developed a similar endeavour of serving as a repository for zines, like the projects queer.archive.work [https://queer.archive.work/], our contribution is to utilize CollectionBuilder to include temporal and spatial dimensions on how these zines were distributed and produced, utilizing metadata to interconnect different cultural productions. Other archives like the Fanzines Argentinos [https://hdlab.space/fanzines-argentinos/] also utilize CollectionBuilder, however, the scope of the project is limited to Argentina. Furthermore, although Fanzines Argentinos includes queer works, this is not necessarily the focus of its curation. For that, we will consider elements like space, time, paradigm (digital, interactive, printed), and the multimodality of its distribution.
