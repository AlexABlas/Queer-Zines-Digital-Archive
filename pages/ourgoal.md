# Our Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a digital archive considering the distribution and production of queer zines, particularly in the Global South and Latin America. On the one hand, we believe that is critical to visibilize cultural productions from the Global South. On the other hand, we defend that build bridges with zines from the Global North can serve as an exercise of solidarity and allyship. Although other projects have developed a similar endevour, like the project [queer.archive.work](queer.archive.work), our contribution is to include how these zines were distributed and produced. For that, we will consider elements like space, time, materiality, and the multimodality of its distribution. 

This is a response for the constant erasure of zines from the Global South and in digital archives.
