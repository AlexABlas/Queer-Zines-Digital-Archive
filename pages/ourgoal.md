# Our Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a proper Latin American digital archive considering their distribution and production. Although other projects have developed a similar endevour, like the project [queer.archive.work](queer.archive.work), our contribution is to include how these zines were distributed and produced. For that, we will consider elements like space, time, materiality, and the multimodality of its distribution.
